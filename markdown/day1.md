## Markdown introduction
Markdown is a lightweight markup language.
Allows people to edit document in a plain text format that is easy to read and write then convert to a valid html document.
The document is written with the suffix .md and .markdown 
I think markdown is the most popular writing language.
## Basic grammar 
### Title 
Use the # sign to indicate level 1-6 titles
<pre>
```markdown
# headinig 1 
## heading 2 
### heading 3 
#### heading 4 
##### heading 5 
###### heading 6 
```
</pre>
>Attention:\
- Leave a space between the last # character and the title.
